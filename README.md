# MostFrequentChar

Recently, I've stumbled upon an interview question where you need to write a code that's optimized for ARM, especially for iphone:

> Write a function which takes an array of char (ASCII symbols) and find
> the most frequent character.
> 
> `char mostFrequentCharacter(char* str, int size)`
> 
> The function should be optimized to run on dual-core ARM-based
> processors, and an infinity amount of memory.
